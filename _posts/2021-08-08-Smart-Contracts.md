Just thought I would leave this here; it was a fun summer working under the mentorship of Dr. Rishiraj Bhattacharyya, School of Computer Sciences, NISER, HBNI, and we took a fair dive into the realm of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and the works.

This was also practically the first proper document I had ever typeset, the first of many to be honest, but I hope it captures the attention of any reader interested in an introduction to the eponymous subject matter.

This might not be your regular dose of Edgar Allan Poe (in which case, you have my admiration), but I never quite make any claims to that extent, do I now?

Dive in and enjoy!
